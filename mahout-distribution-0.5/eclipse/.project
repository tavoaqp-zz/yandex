  <comment>Mahout&apos;s goal is to build scalable machine learning libraries. With scalable we mean: Scalable to
    reasonably large data sets. Our core algorithms for clustering, classfication and batch based collaborative
    filtering are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. However we do not restrict
    contributions to Hadoop based implementations: Contributions that run on a single node or on a non-Hadoop
    cluster are welcome as well. The core libraries are highly optimized to allow for good performance also for
    non-distributed algorithms. Scalable to support your business case. Mahout is distributed under a commercially
    friendly Apache Software license. Scalable community. The goal of Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive,
    diverse community to facilitate discussions not only on the project itself but also on potential use cases. Come
    to the mailing lists to find out more. Currently Mahout supports mainly four use cases: Recommendation mining
    takes users&apos; behavior and from that tries to find items users might like. Clustering takes e.g. text documents
    and groups them into groups of topically related documents. Classification learns from exisiting categorized
    documents what documents of a specific category look like and is able to assign unlabelled documents to the
    (hopefully) correct category. Frequent itemset mining takes a set of item groups (terms in a query session,
    shopping cart content) and identifies, which individual items usually appear together. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
